vAttack
=======

A console game about making viruses, and stuff.

This game is just a concept, in console-form for a project I may be starting soon that will expand on this idea.
If this game goes over well and works like I expect it to work, I'll make a new project, with a proper GUI, and all those great frills.
Along with a lot of new gameplay and features of course. If you'd like to keep up with
development, the github project is the best way to do so. http://github.com/Ispira/vAttack/
